# OmniBoxEx

## Kudos

This is a copy of a WebComponent called
OmniBox. I just copied it into a phoenix
live view application to try out get it
working with liveview.

Be aware that this is a work in Progress, so it will not yet work!!

## Progress on fly



## Phoenix setup

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
